```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```

## cities of the world
```{r chuck1, echo=TRUE}

data <- read.csv("worldcities.csv")

colnames(data)

```

### Objective
  - Our objective is to create map with markers having information like name and population.
  

## Preprocessing 

- we need columns like population , city_ascii, lat and lng from the raw data.

```{r chuck2}
new.data <- data%>%
  select(city_ascii,lat,lng,population)%>%
  rename(name = city_ascii)

head(new.data)
```



## Cities Map

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
new.data%>%
  leaflet()%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addMarkers(popup = new.data$population)
```
